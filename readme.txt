Get paid for job listings on WP Job Manager with cubepoints.

== Description ==
Charge users 1 cubepoint to post a job posting on your blog. Works with and requires both WP Job Manager and cubepoints to be installed.

[Main Site](http://beprosoftware.com/) | [Support Forum](http://beprosoftware.com/forums/) | [Pro Version](http://www.beprosoftware.com/shop/wp-job-manager-cubepoints/) | [Hire a Developer](http://beprosoftware.com/jobs/)

Once installed, the job poster is presented with a notice if he/she does not have enough points. If they do have the points, there is no notice

One point is automatically subtracted from the poster once they save their job posting.

= Charge Users =

This plugin provides you with the ability to monetize your job board for free. However, some may find it profitable to charge one set of users compared to the other. Or it may be important to charge more than one point. The pro version of this plugin, provides that flexibility, to select who to charge and how much. At the same time, we help you to communicate the charge to the end user, so they know how to proceed.

= Pro Version =

If interested in controlling a lot more of the process then consider our Pro version. It can be installed as a cubepoints module or plugin, up to you. Features include:

* Specify how much to charge applicants if anything
* Specift how much to charge job posters if anything
* Customize the message shown to posters in the "submit job" form
* Customize the message shown to posters with insufficient funds
* Customize the message shown to applicants with insufficient funds

= Cubepoints for Customers =

For some there is the obvious question of how does the customer get points. You can use a plugin like [WooCube Pro](www.beprosoftware.com/shop/woocube-pro/) to allow the purchasing of points through woocommerce. Once users have purchased points, they can then use them for creating or applying to jobs
