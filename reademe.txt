One point is automatically subtracted from the poster once they save their job posting.

= Charge Users =

This plugin provides you with the ability to monetize your job board for free. However, some may find it profitable to charge one set of users compared to the other. Or it may be important to charge more than one point, especially if you are using a cubepoints rate conversion plugin like woocube. The pro versio of this plugin, provides that flexibility, to select who to charge and how much. At the same time, we help you to communicate the charge to the end user, so they know how to proceed.
